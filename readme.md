# Idle Pixels

Idle Pixels is a idle game where you click monsters to destroy them. Collect gold and become the hero of the land! This project was originally built as part of a small 36 hour game jam with a couple of friends. We have become rather fond of it and continue to add updates when we can.

## Getting Started

Right now the only way to play the game is by downloading it and running it in developement mode. See the "development" section below.

## Development

### Prerequisites

You will need to have [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed on your machine. 

### Setup

Step by step guide to setting up the project and running the development server.

Clone this repository and open your terminal in the repo directory. Then you need to start by installing all of the dependencies through yarn. The command is very simple, just type the following and hit enter:

```
yarn
```

Once you've completed that and have all the dependencies, to run the game in a development server you need to run this command:

```
yarn dev
```

This will open a live testing server where changes you make to the project instantly show up without refreshing. Connect to the address given to you by webpack. (Usually localhost:8080)
